![Kong and Insomnia](/images/blog/kong-insomnia.png)

Four years ago, I was hunched over my desk, searching for a cURL command that I'd painstakingly
put together the week before.

I was on a call with a customer and knew I had the exact snippet to solve their problem, but 
there were too many. I had folders on top of folders of these things and they all looked pretty 
much the same! I had to give up, tell the customer that I'd send it to them later, and hung up
feeling frustrated and embarrassed. There had to be a better way. ðŸŒ¤

Insomnia was created to help make APIs easier to explore, debug, and share. I released the
[first version](https://schier.co/blog/2014/12/07/call-for-beta-testers.html) in 2014
and it quickly caught on. People started recommending it to their friends, writing blog posts, and 
sending in mountains of feedback.

I [quit my job](https://schier.co/blog/2016/08/05/forging-a-new-path/) in 2016 to focus on 
Insomnia full-time and [released the app as open-source](/blog/open-source-announcement) in 2017 
to help fill in the gaps. Insomnia now has over 100 open-source contributors and is used by 
hundreds of thousands of developers every week!

But there's still lots to do, which is why I'm excited to announce that 
**Insomnia is now part of [Kong](https://konghq.com/)** ðŸ¥³. Kong shares the same commitment to 
open source and Aghi (Kong's CEO) has supported Insomnia since the very beginning.

With the help of Kong, we'll be able to take Insomnia even further and tackle some of the 
larger problems that the community has been discussing for a while. I'm so proud of how far
Insomnia has come and can't wait to see where it goes from here.

This is a lot to take in, and you probably have some questions, so here you go:

> 
**Who is Kong?**<br>
Kong is a Microservice and API company that make a cloud-native API Gateway. They are driven 
by the opensource community, and aim to improve the experience of developing, deploying, and 
managing APIs.
><br><br>
>
**Will I still be able to use Insomnia?**<br>
Yes, both the Insomnia opensource project and Insomnia Plus will continue to operate as it 
does today.
><br><br>
>
**How will I access my Insomnia account?**<br>
The same way as always. Log in to your Insomnia account using your email address and password.


Hopefully this answers any questions you have, but if there's anything else you're curious about, 
feel free to [send an email](mailto:support@insomnia.rest).
